	<p> The Dark Knight is my favorite movie because it offers multiple perspectives of how one can become evil or stay "good." I also like it because it's an action packed filmed with unpredictable plot twists, and Heath Ledger's amazing acting as the Joker helps too. </p>
	<p> As you can probably infer from the sentence above, my favorite actor in the movie is Heath Ledger. I feel like he does such an excellent job of creating a psychopathic yet clever man to fight neck to neck with Batman himself. As I was watching the Joker interrogation scene, the way he laughed maniacally and acted like someone who belonged in an insane asylum just felt so real to me.</p>
